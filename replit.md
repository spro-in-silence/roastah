# Roastah - Multi-Vendor Coffee Marketplace

## Overview

Roastah is a comprehensive, Etsy-style multi-vendor marketplace specifically designed for home and micro coffee roasters. The platform combines a custom-built marketplace with MedusaJS integration to provide enterprise-grade e-commerce capabilities while maintaining a user-friendly experience for both roasters and coffee enthusiasts.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** and **Radix UI** for consistent, accessible design
- **React Router** for client-side routing and navigation
- **TanStack React Query** for efficient server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with **Zod** for form handling and validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js** with **Express** for the main application server
- **MedusaJS** integration for enterprise e-commerce features
- **PostgreSQL** via **Neon** for primary data storage
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Stripe Connect Express** for multi-vendor payment processing
- **WebSocket** implementation for real-time features

### Hybrid Data Strategy
The application uses a dual-database approach:
- **Custom PostgreSQL schema** for core marketplace features (users, products, orders)
- **MedusaJS database** for advanced e-commerce capabilities
- **Bridge service** for seamless data synchronization between systems

## Key Components

- **Tag-based filtering** (unlisted, preorder, private, out of stock)
- **Bulk product upload** with CSV processing
- **Real-time inventory tracking**
- **Product recommendations** using similarity algorithms

### Order Processing
- **Multi-vendor order management**
- **Real-time order tracking** with WebSocket updates
- **Commission calculation** for platform fees
- **Stripe Connect** for direct seller payouts

### Search & Discovery
- **Advanced product filtering** by origin, roast level, price range
- **Real-time search** capabilities
- **Favorite roasters** and **wishlist** functionality
- **Leaderboard** for top-performing roasters

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket-based notifications**

- **Centralized loading context** prevents loading flashes and provides consistent UX

## Data Flow

### Product Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Roasters create products through the seller dashboard
2. **Validation**: Products undergo validation and can be saved as drafts
3. **Publication**: Approved products are published to the marketplace
4. **Synchronization**: Products are automatically synced to MedusaJS for advanced features
5. **Discovery**: Published products appear in search results and recommendations

### Order Processing
1. **Cart Management**: Users add products with customizable options (grind size, quantity)
2. **Checkout**: Stripe integration handles payment processing
3. **Order Distribution**: Orders are split by vendor for individual processing
4. **Tracking**: Real-time updates flow through WebSocket connections
5. **Commission**: Platform fees are calculated and distributed

### Cache Management
- **Dual cache strategy** combining immediate updates and invalidation
- **Optimistic updates** for instant UI feedback
- **Consistent data synchronization** across all views
- **Smart cache invalidation** to prevent stale data issues

## External Dependencies

### Payment Processing
- **Stripe Connect Express** for multi-vendor payments
- **Stripe API** for subscription management and payment intents
- **Automatic commission calculation** and distribution

### Cloud Services

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Concurrent development servers** for frontend and backend
- **Hot module replacement** for rapid development
- **Automated database migrations** during development

### Production Build Process
1. **Database Migration Generation**: `pnpm run db:generate`
2. **Application Build**: Separate frontend and backend builds
3. **Dependency Validation**: Check for development dependencies in production
4. **Docker Image Creation**: Multi-stage build with production optimizations
5. **Cloud Run Deployment**: Automatic scaling and health checks

### Security Measures
- **Content Security Policy** implementation
- **Rate limiting** on all API endpoints
- **Input validation** using Zod schemas
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
