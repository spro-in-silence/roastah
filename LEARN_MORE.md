## A little backstory...

Roastah didn’t start in a boardroom. It started in a basement—surrounded by bags of green coffee, half-written roast logs, and the smell of something *becoming*.

The first time I tasted a home-roasted bean, it changed me. Not because it was perfect—it wasn’t. But because someone had taken raw potential and turned it into something deeply personal. That bag, scrawled on with a gold paint pen, was my first window into a world that was chaotic, obsessive, and absolutely beautiful.

That was the spark.

Roastah was born from that moment—built not just for coffee drinkers, but for the ones who roast. The ones who tinker. Who chase the impossible “just right.” Who fill notebooks with temps and charge rates and hit “first crack” like it’s the drop in their favorite track.

This isn’t just software. It’s a tribute.  
To craft.  
To community.  
To the long, winding road between green bean and greatness.

## What Roastah is (and isn’t)

Roastah is a living, breathing platform where roasters—from garages to cafés—can share, discover, and sell their work. It’s a place to compare notes, track your journey, and support one another.

It’s not venture-backed. It’s not corporate.  
It’s indie. It’s messy. It’s roasting.

This is alpha. Expect bugs. Expect updates.  
But most of all, expect heart.

## Behind the Logo

You might’ve noticed the scribble.

It’s not a placeholder. It’s the logo.

It was inspired by the very first bag of home-roasted beans I ever bought. The roaster had scrawled “El Salvador” on a matte black bag in gold ink. That little imperfection stuck with me. It felt *real*. Human.

Later, I came across a scientific image: the Lagrangian trajectory of tumbling coffee beans inside a roaster. It looked wild. Messy. But in its chaos, there was order. That, I realized, is what roasting is.

So I drew a scribble. A chaotic line that echoes that trajectory—a symbol of motion, imperfection, and intention.  
That’s the Roastah mark.

It’s not polished. Not yet.  
But neither is the roast. And that’s kind of the point.
