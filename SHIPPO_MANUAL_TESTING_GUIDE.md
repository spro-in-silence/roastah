## Production Readiness

### Before Going Live:
1. **Replace test API key** with live Shippo key
2. **Configure webhooks** for real-time updates  
3. **Set up monitoring** for shipping failures
4. **Test with real orders** and addresses
5. **Verify carrier integrations** are working

### Monitoring Points:
- API response times
- Failed rate calculations
- Label generation errors
- Tracking update failures
- Return processing issues

## Support

### If You Encounter Issues:
1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Verify authentication is working
3. Confirm API endpoints are responding
4. Test with simpler requests first
5. Check the Shippo dashboard for API usage
